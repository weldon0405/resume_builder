# User Interface Design Document (UIDD)

## Layout Structure
- **Single-Page Dashboard**:
  - A central screen with collapsible sections for:
    1. Achievements Library
    2. Job Description Analysis
    3. Suggested Resume Snippets
  - **Header**: Displays logo, user profile, settings, and logout.
  - **Vertical Sidebar**: Quick navigation links to each section, ensuring a clear structure.

## Core Components
1. **Achievements Library**
   - Displays a list/table of user-added achievements (imported or manually entered).
   - Users can add, edit, and delete achievements from this module.
   - Filtering and tagging for quick search.

2. **Job Description Analysis**
   - Area where users paste or upload a job description file.
   - AI-driven panel processes the content, highlighting key competencies.
   - Indicators of which achievements align well with the posting.

3. **Suggested Resume Snippets**
   - Shows recommended sentences or sections that the user can copy/paste.
   - Allows quick edits directly within this module if necessary.

## Interaction Patterns
- **Collapsible Sections**: Each section can be expanded/collapsed, letting users focus on one task at a time.
- **Drag-and-Drop or Button Actions**: 
  - Move relevant achievements into a “Draft Snippet” area.
  - Quick copy button for final resume text.
- **Inline Editing**: Users can edit achievements, tags, or snippet text directly in the list.
- **Modal Dialogs**: Used for importing achievements from external sources (LinkedIn, PDF, Word).

## Visual Design Elements & Color Scheme
- **Clean, Minimalist Layout**: Emphasize whitespace for clarity.
- **Subtle Color Accents**:
  - Primary color for highlight actions (buttons, links).
  - Muted palette for secondary sections (sidebars, background cards).
- **Clear Labels and Icons**: Each module with distinct icons for recognizability.

## Mobile, Web App, Desktop Considerations
- **Desktop-First MVP**:
  - Optimized for typical screen sizes (e.g., 1366x768 or higher).
  - Clear horizontal space for main content and sidebar.
- **Mobile/Web Responsive**:
  - Future versions can adopt fully responsive design.
  - Sidebar collapses on smaller screens if needed.

## Typography
- **Readable Sans-Serif**: A font like Open Sans or Roboto, 14–16px base size.
- **Font Hierarchy**:
  - Larger, bold headings for section titles.
  - Medium-weight subheadings.
  - Regular-weight body text for achievements, descriptions, and instructions.

## Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**:
  - All clickable elements reachable via tab.
  - Clear focus states for each button or text field.
- **Contrast Ratios**:
  - Text/background contrast meets WCAG standards.
- **Alt Text on Icons**:
  - Descriptive alternative text for screen readers.
- **Descriptive Labels**:
  - Forms, upload fields, and edit features labeled with ARIA attributes if appropriate.
